# Random
A wrapper class that implements JavaScript Math.random() function, which provides approximately uniform distribution over the range of numbers between 0 to 1. As specified in the algorithm, no seed can be chosen or reset by the user; it is set initially by the algorithm. The wrapper class helps the user perform various scalings and manipulations on the number generated.

## General Info

This project was developed to generate Random numbers under the given conditions that are not available in JavaScript by default. Need was found to repeatedly write and rewrite many of these functions to do work with various projects, so in order to follow the principles of encapsulation and writing code as DRYly as possible, the Random class was found to be clearly necessary.

## Technologies Used

This project is built using es6 class structures, defining a private, as well as JavaScript can do so, range of values within which the numbers can be randomly generated.

## Features

The functions implemented by the wrapper class allow the user to generate either a random numbers between specified values.
* The specified values are two integers specified by the user.
* The user can generate a uniformly distributed number between those specified values.
* The user can generate a uniformly distributed integer betweem those specified values.
* The user can choose a random element of a given array.
